## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Overall Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/gateway_architecture.svg" alt="Gateway Layered Architecture" width="100%">
</p>

FLUX Gateway adopts a layered architecture design, divided into four layers from bottom to top:

- **Access Layer**: Supports multiple protocols including HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC, TCP/UDP
- **Gateway Core Layer**: Contains core engines such as routing, authentication, rate limiting, proxy, monitoring, circuit breaking, caching, plugins, security, and load balancing
- **Management Layer**: Provides configuration management, service discovery, health checks, log management, and other management functions
- **Storage Layer**: Supports multiple storage systems including MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, ClickHouse

### Tunnel Architecture - Intranet Penetration Principle

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/tunnel_architecture.svg" alt="Intranet Penetration Architecture" width="100%">
</p>

#### Working Principle

FLUX Gateway's intranet penetration is based on FRP architecture design, adopting a **control and data separation** mode:

**① Server (Public Network)**
- **Control Port (7000)**: Accepts client registration, Token authentication, heartbeat keep-alive
- **Data Ports**: 
  - Static mapping ports (e.g., 80, 8080, 2222) - Pre-configured fixed ports
  - Dynamic allocation ports - Dynamically allocated when clients register
- **Core Components**: Session management, service registration, connection tracking, load balancing, static mapping, traffic forwarding

**② Client (Intranet)**
- **Control Connection**: Connects to server port 7000 for Token authentication and service registration
- **Service Management**: Register local services, automatic reconnection, heartbeat keep-alive
- **Proxy Forwarding**: Receives traffic forwarded by the server and proxies it to local services

**③ Penetration Flow**
1. Client connects to server through control port, completes authentication and service registration
2. User accesses public network address (e.g., example.com:80)
3. Server forwards user request to corresponding client through control connection
4. Client proxies traffic to local service (e.g., localhost:8080)
5. Response data returns along the same path, completing intranet penetration

#### Supported Modes

- **Static Port Mapping**: Pre-configure fixed port mapping relationships in the database
- **Dynamic Service Registration**: Clients dynamically register services at startup, server allocates ports
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, UDP, WebSocket, and other protocols
